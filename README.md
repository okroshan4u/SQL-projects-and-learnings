# 🗄️ SQL Projects Repository

Welcome to my **SQL Projects Repository**!  
This repository is a collection of all my **SQL-based projects**, focused on data analysis, database design, optimization, and querying real-world datasets. Each project demonstrates practical SQL skills and problem-solving approaches using different database systems such as **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SQLite**.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repo is dedicated **solely to SQL projects** — no Python, Power BI, or Excel files here.  
It’s a central place to explore how I use SQL for:

- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Query optimization and performance tuning  
- Building relational databases and ERDs  
- Analyzing business data through advanced SQL queries  
- Exploring complex joins, subqueries, and window functions
